# React homework template

My project, titled 'Phonebook Pro,' presents a user-friendly phonebook
application tightly integrated with a Swagger backend API. This comprehensive
solution allows users to seamlessly register, log in, add, remove, filter, and
edit contacts, along with convenient logout functionality.

For the frontend development, I utilized HTML and CSS to craft an appealing and
responsive user interface. Leveraging the power of React.js, along with Redux
Toolkit and React Hooks, I ensured dynamic and efficient frontend
functionalities, enabling smooth user interactions and state management. Routers
were seamlessly integrated to facilitate smooth navigation within the
application.

On the backend side, I implemented robust registration, authentication, and
contact management functionalities using the Swagger API. The incorporation of
Redux Thunk facilitated the handling of asynchronous actions and efficient state
management.

Throughout the development process, I maintained version control using Git and
GitHub, ensuring organized and collaborative development.

With 'Phonebook Pro,' managing contacts becomes intuitive and effortless,
offering users a reliable solution to stay organized and connected."
